Project Overview
The IP Tracker web application is designed to provide users with real-time IP tracking and geolocation data visualization on an interactive map. This tool is built with a focus on security, usability, and responsive performance. By leveraging external APIs for IP tracking and mapping, this application enables users to locate IP addresses on a map, view detailed information, and download or print IP details for easy record-keeping.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login system that ensures data is only accessible to authorized users.
Real-Time IP Lookup: Users can enter an IP address to retrieve location information, including details like city, country, and ISP.
Map Integration: The Google Maps API displays IP location on an interactive map, allowing zoom and navigation.
Download and Print Options: Users can download or print IP details for documentation purposes.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express
External APIs:
IP Tracking API for IP-based geolocation data.
Google Maps API for interactive map visualization.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v12+ recommended)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com:ejirocastro/trakkr_alx.git
cd ip-tracker
Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

bash
Copy code
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in both backend and frontend directories.
Add your API keys for the IP tracking and Google Maps APIs, along with any other necessary environment variables.
Start the application:

bash
Copy code
# Start backend server
cd backend
npm run start

# Start frontend server
cd ../frontend
npm run start
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Usage
1. User Login
Users need to log in to access the IP tracking feature, which ensures data security and controlled access.
2. IP Lookup
After logging in, users can enter an IP address in the search field and submit to retrieve location data.
The application displays city, country, ISP, and other location details.
3. Interactive Map
The map, powered by Google Maps API, provides a visual reference for the IP location.
Users can interact with the map, zooming in/out and exploring the IPâ€™s geographical area.
4. Download/Print IP Details
Users have the option to download or print IP data, allowing for easy record-keeping and sharing.
API Integration
IP Tracking API: Retrieves geolocation data based on the IP address entered by the user.

This API fetches information like city, country, and ISP for the provided IP.
IP data is securely handled by the backend and presented to the user in a clear format.
Google Maps API: Displays the IP location on an interactive map.

Integrated on the frontend, the map provides zoom and navigation functionality, helping users visualize IP location geographically.
Authentication
The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless user authentication. Upon successful login, users are provided with a token, which they must present to access IP tracking features. This approach balances security with user experience, ensuring that data remains private and accessible only to authorized users.

Future Enhancements
Future improvements planned for the IP Tracker project include:

Advanced Filtering: Options for users to refine IP searches by ISP, region, or other criteria.
Enhanced Data Visualization: Clustering and overlays on the map for a better user experience with multiple IPs.
Performance Optimization: Improved caching and API request handling for smoother performance under high traffic.
